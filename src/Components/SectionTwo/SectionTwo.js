                        Oh! Hi there! My name is Diganta and I'm a senior engineering student who's always looking for ways to mix my love of computer science and web development with my passion for cricket and chess. If you need a website built or a cricket game won, I'm your guy. Just don't challenge me to a game of chess unless you're ready to be beaten by a master strategist (or at least, that's what I tell myself). When I'm not hitting sixes or checkmating opponents, I'm always up for a good chat and learning new things, so don't be shy and say hi
            </div>
